<h1>Machine Learning Project on Chocolate Rating</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Kaiqi Guo is currently a student at the Masters in Data Science project and University of San Francisco. </p>

<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>This project focuses on predicting chocolate rating from different features of chocolate (e.g. type of cocoa bean). By begin able to predict chocolate's rating, we could potentially reduce the cost of chocolate development by eliminating combinations chocolate features before development begins. As consumers, we could also reduce the chance of spending money on chocolate that's not as tasty.</p>

<h2>What We Learned</h2>
<p>Taste test are the strongest predictors of chocolate rating with the score that the biggest coefficient does not involve other features of chocolate (e.g. kind of beans, cocoa content). An interesting next step another step would be to use custom word embedding to better encode the taste test to study the relationship between features of chocolate and the flavor graders taste and hence the rating.</p>
